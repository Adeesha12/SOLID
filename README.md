### **Class**
```python
class Employee: #// this is a class
    pass
```

### **Class attribute**
```python
class Employee: #// this is a class
    company_name = 'BST' #// this is class attribute

emp1 = Employee()   #// this is an object
emp2 = Employee()   #// this is an object

print(emp1.company_name)
print(emp2.company_name)
```
> output
```
  'BST'
  'BST'
```

### **Instance attribute**
```python
class Employee: #// this is a class
    company_name = 'BST' #// this is class attribute

emp1 = Employee()   #// this is an object
emp2 = Employee()   #// this is an object

emp1.name = 'rick'  #// this is a instance attribute

print(emp1.company_name)
print(emp2.company_name)
   
print(emp1.name)   
print(emp2.name) 
```
There is a one instace attribute so it will throw an attribute for emp2.name which is not exist !
> output
```
